AI_for_Bharat_OOPs
We are building the 'SafeAI: An Independent Governance & Inference-Time Guardrail Engine' for the AI for Communities, Access & Public Impact track.
The Problem: Generative AI faces two critical security gaps: (1) Semantic Jailbreaks, where users bypass native filters to generate harmful content (e.g., the Grok crisis), and (2) Intellectual Property (IP) Mimicry, where AI is misused to unauthorizedly replicate proprietary artistic visual signatures (e.g., the Ghibli trend) and exploit community-sourced digital repositories.
The Solution: A decoupled, supervisor-led 'Inference-Time' firewall that monitors the interaction between the user and the LLM in real-time. It acts as an independent 'Circuit Breaker' to verify both the intent of the prompt and the integrity of the output.
